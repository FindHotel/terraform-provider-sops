# sops Provider

The Sops provider offers functions to work with [sops](https://getsops.io/) encrypted files.

This provider is inspired by the
[carlpett/terraform-provider-sops](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/carlpett/sops)
provider, but instead of using data sources, it implements its functionality as functions.
This approach provides more flexibility and ensures that decrypted data is not stored in the
state file.

Moreover, if the decrypted data is in one of the supported formats (`yaml`, `json`, `dotenv`, `ini`), it will also be
returned as a nested object in the `data` attribute. This allows for easier
access to specific values within structured data.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# There are no configuration options
provider "sops" {}
```
